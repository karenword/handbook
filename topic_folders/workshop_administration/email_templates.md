##### General inquiry response

Dear %name%,

Thanks so much for inquiring about a Carpentries workshop at %site_name%.  Here's some background about our programs and how we run.

Software Carpentry (SWC) and Data Carpentry (DC) are two sibling organizations. Both programs offer two day long workshops taught by a team of two instructors, trained and certified by us. Software Carpentry focuses on best practices in computational programming that help scientists and researchers be more effective with their work. Lessons are domain agnostic and use generic data. All Software Carpentry workshops always cover three core areas: shell scripting (bash), version control (Git), and a programming language (R or Python, your choice). Read more [here](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/). Data Carpentry has a similar foundation but focuses on the data lifecycle, from cleaning & organization to analysis & visualization. Lessons and the data they use are domain specific, with offerings in ecology/biology, genomics, geospatial data, and more in the works. Read more [here](http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/ ).

All workshops have a standard fee of US$2500, plus any costs for instructor travel (which may include airfare, ground travel, hotel, and meals/incidentals).
You can read more about the costs and how to request a workshop here for [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/workshops/request/) and here for [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/workshops-host/).

Workshops are offered on demand, not on a set schedule, and typically require 2-3 months lead time to plan.

I'd be happy to answer any questions you have about holding a Carpentries workshop at %site_name% by email, or set some time to talk by phone or videocall. Let me know what you're thinking of doing, and we'll talk about how we can work together.  I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best,

##### Host and instructor introductions

Hi everyone,

This email is to introduce %host_first_name% %host_last_name% of %site_name% with instructors %instructor1_first_name% %instructor1_last_name% and %instructor2_first_name% %instructor2_last_name%. They will be teaching a %carpentry_type% workshop on %workshop_date%.

I also want to introduce our Workshop Administrator, %admin_name%. %She or he% will be supporting all of the logistical details with this workshop.

Next steps:

Instructors will work directly with %host_first_name% to make travel arrangements. We are not part of this process. This may include airfare, ground travel, hotel, and meals/incidentals. %host_first_name%, it is up to you whether you want to book things directly or have instructors make their own arrangements and get reimbursed. Either way, please keep in mind our instructors are volunteering two days of their time to teach with you, so please support them in making travel as smooth as possible.

You can all read more about the roles of workshop hosts, instructors, and helpers [here](https://software-carpentry.org/workshops/operations/). I'll highlight a few things here.

%host_first_name% , can you share a little about who your learners are and what you and they are expecting? That will help our instructors be prepared. We also like to have a couple of helpers at each workshop from the local community. Would you be able to help secure a couple of helpers? They don't need to be connected with us; they just need a good understanding of the technologies we teach and an enthusiasm to help others.

%instructor1_first_name% and %instructor2_first_name%, please feel free to introduce yourselves and share a bit about your backgrounds. We value the background and expertise you bring to this, and want to hear about you.

%instructor1_first_name% and %instructor2_first_name% will divide up the curriculum:

https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/

OR

http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/

to know who's teaching what. One of them will create the workshop's web page on GitHub, which will include workshop details and instructions on what learners will need to install on their computers. The template can be found here:

https://github.com/datacarpentry/workshop-template

OR

https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template

Please use the workshop id %workshop_id%

%host_first_name% , if you want to handle registration internally that's fine. Otherwise %admin_name% can work with you to create an Eventbrite registration page. She will need to know a total count, the registration fee (if any, as well as a refund policy), and the exact location. Regardless, all learners should complete pre/post workshop surveys which will be available on the webpage the instructors create. %admin_name% will share links so you all can view survey results.

%admin_name% will check in over the next few weeks and after it's all over to hear how it went -- including getting attendance figures, ideally broken out by number registered and number attended each day. Any of you are also welcome to join our instructor discussion sessions before and/or after the workshop. It's a great way to ask questions and share ideas with other instructors before you teach, and to give us feedback after you teach. Check out the schedule and sign up here: http://pad.software-carpentry.org/instructor-discussion

We are so glad to have everyone confirmed for this. Please email any questions you all may have for us or each other.  

Thanks so much! 

##### Other instructors placed

##### Sharing survey results

*template coming soon*

##### Post workshop check in

Hi  [instructor],

Thank you for volunteering your time to teach a Carpentry workshop on %dates% at %site_name%! We appreciate the dedication you’ve shown to help spread data literacy skills, and the hard work you put into preparing for and teaching your workshop.

In order to help us accurately report our progress, we need a few things from you. Please take a moment to provide us with the following information. It would be greatly appreciated.

* The total number of learners registered
* The total attendance for each day
* Any additional feedback that you would like to share with us about the overall experience of your workshop

Additionally, please remind your learners to complete the post-workshop survey. This survey asks them to self-evaluate how much they’ve learned and also to give their perspectives on the workshop’s major strengths and opportunities for improvement. Let me know if you need access to the survey results.

For your convenience, below you will find several resources that are available to you as an instructor.  

* Weekly instructors discussion sessions where you can share your feedback and hear from other instructors. Feel free to join us whenever you are available. Check out the calendar here. Be sure to check your timezone :) 
* Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry  blog posts from instructors and workshop hosts who share their experience conducting a workshop. You are more than welcome to contribute as well! If this is something that interests you, please let me know. 

If you have any questions regarding anything I’ve shared do not hesitate to email me directly.  Thanks for all of your hard work running this workshop!

Best, 

%your_name%
